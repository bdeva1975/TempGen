# OpenAI Text Response Generator with Adjustable Temperature

This repository demonstrates a simple Python CLI tool that interacts with OpenAI's API to generate text responses. The program allows you to input a prompt and adjust the `temperature` parameter, which controls the randomness and creativity of the output. The higher the temperature, the more diverse and unpredictable the responses become, whereas lower temperatures result in more focused and deterministic outputs.

## Features

- **Dynamic Prompt Input**: Enter any prompt to receive a detailed response generated by OpenAI.
- **Adjustable Temperature**: Control the variability and creativity of the model's output using the `temperature` parameter.
- **Batch Responses**: The program generates three distinct responses to showcase the impact of the `temperature` parameter.

## How Temperature Works

The **temperature** parameter plays a crucial role in defining how random or creative the model's output can be. Here's how it works:

- **Low Temperature (0)**: The model produces highly focused, deterministic, and often predictable responses. It tends to choose the most likely next word for the given context, leading to a more "precise" and consistent output.
  
  - Example: A temperature of `0` is perfect for tasks requiring accuracy, like summarizing text or answering factual questions.

- **Moderate Temperature (~0.5)**: At mid-level temperatures, the model introduces some variability. It still generates coherent responses but might incorporate a bit of creative freedom, useful for tasks like generating ideas or brainstorming.

- **High Temperature (1.0 and above)**: The model becomes highly creative, even to the point of being less predictable or making mistakes. It explores a wider range of possible completions, which can be useful for creative writing, poetry, or generating unexpected ideas.

  - Example: A temperature of `1.0` or above would be suitable for creative tasks, such as writing fictional stories or generating new and diverse content.

The temperature scale typically ranges between `0` and `1`. Values greater than `1` increase randomness significantly, but can sometimes make responses less coherent. Values closer to `0` will make the model highly focused and deterministic.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TempGen.git
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install openai python-dotenv
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your OpenAI API key:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   ```

### Running the Program

To run the program, pass the input prompt and desired temperature as command-line arguments.

```bash
python temperature.py "<your prompt here>" <temperature>
```

Example:

```bash
python app.py "Tell me a joke" 0.8
```

This command will generate three different responses based on the provided temperature.

### Example Outputs

1. **With temperature = 0 (deterministic):**
   ```bash
   python app.py "What is the capital of France?" 0
   ```

   ```
   The capital of France is Paris.
   ```

2. **With temperature = 0.8 (creative):**
   ```bash
   python app.py "Tell me a story about a robot and a cat" 0.8
   ```

   ```
   Once upon a time, there was a robot named Bolt who lived in a small town. One day, he met a stray cat named Whiskers...
   ```

3. **With temperature = 1.0 (highly creative and random):**
   ```bash
   python app.py "Write a poem about stars" 1.0
   ```

   ```
   Twinkling sparks in velvet skies,  
   Dancing light where mystery lies,  
   Far beyond our reach they fly,  
   Guiding souls as they pass by...
   ```

### Customization

- You can modify the model in the code by changing the `model="gpt-3.5-turbo"` line to use different OpenAI models if needed.
- The program generates three responses by default. You can adjust the number of responses by modifying the loop in the `__main__` block.
